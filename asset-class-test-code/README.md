# php-cascade-ws-ns-examples/asset-class-test-code
Instead of posting all the test code in my cascade-admin site, I post it all here for quick reference. For each class, I will try to test as many methods as possible. Therefore, these test programs illustrate how to use methods defined in each class.

Note that the test code assumes the library written in PHP7.
